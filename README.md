## Clothes Lovers Unite

https://clothesloversunite.herokuapp.com/

### The Problem
My used clothing stores, especially in Melbourne have become quite expensive. Wanted to keep the cost low. Great for the environment. Pass on your loved clothes knowing that someone else will love them as much as you did. Sometimes they struggle to give away loved items of clothing.

### The Solution
Clothes Lovers Unite!

### Brainstorming Name
I used Trello to brainstorm names for the app. I wrote down key words that came to mind. My original app idea was for trading or swapping clothes. For the sake of this project it best to have users simple buying and selling items. A lot of my names used the words swapping or trading. As this is not the purpose of the app I decided to steer aways from these conitations. I decided upon 'Clothes Lovers Unite' as my target audience is people who love and appreciate their clothes. The use of the word unite is to create a sense of community and sharing.

### Enitiy Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Used Database Designer to create the ERD. I started my ERD and then moved to the flow diagram. Thsi helped me to figure out sectiosn that I ahd missed on the ERD.

### Flow Diagram
This process was a lot harder than I had expected. Realsied how much thought goes into websites and where to send users with each click. My aim is to make the app user friendly and easy to navigate. I wanted to reduce the amount of clicks that was required to get to each feature.

### Wireframes
Wanted to make the layout simple.

### Design Decisions
Did not spend a great amount of time on design. Found the logo on Canva and used that as inspiration.
Wanted to make it simple, clean and fun.

Found this colour palette and just adjusted the yellow to the one from the logo.
